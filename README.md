# Brain_Viz
Three.js based brain visualisations for vector fields, singularities and streamlines


# BrainBrowser
BrainBrowser is a JavaScript library allowing for web-based, 2D and 3D visualization of neurological data. It consists of the Surface Viewer, a real-time 3D rendering tool for visualizing surface data, and the Volume Viewer, a slice-by-slice volumetric data analysis tool.

BrainBrowser uses open web-standard technologies such as HTML5, CSS, JavaScript and WebGL. The Surface Viewer uses three.js for 3D rendering.

Demonstrations of available functionality can be found at the BrainBrowser website.


Key Components:
 - Visualise Pial surface with some transparency.
 - Plot vector fields with a time slider because vector fields is time dependent.
 - Plot streamlines on top of pial surfaces and vector fields. streamlines are also time dependent.
