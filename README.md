# Brain_Viz
Three.js based brain visualisations for vector fields, singularities and streamlines

Key Components:
 - Visualise Pial surface with some transparency.
 - Plot vector fields with a time slider because vector fields is time dependent.
 - Plot streamlines on top of pial surfaces and vector fields. streamlines are also time dependent.
